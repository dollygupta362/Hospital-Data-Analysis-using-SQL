## 📌 Overview

This project is a hands-on SQL analysis task completed as part of the "30 Days SQL Micro Course". Using a structured hospital dataset, I designed and executed 10 SQL queries to derive actionable healthcare insights.

The focus was on applying PostgreSQL to solve realistic analytical problems such as calculating averages, identifying trends, and grouping data over time.

## 🎯 Assignment Objectives

A set of 10 structured SQL queries were written to analyze hospital performance and patient trends:

| # | Query Objective |
|---|-----------------|
| 1 | Total number of patients across all hospitals |
| 2 | Average number of doctors per hospital |
| 3 | Top 3 departments with the most patients |
| 4 | Hospital with the highest medical expenses |
| 5 | Average medical expenses per day (normalized by stay duration) |
| 6 | Patient with the longest hospital stay |
| 7 | City-wise total patient count |
| 8 | Average length of stay per department |
| 9 | Department with the fewest patients |
| 10 | Monthly medical expense summary |

Each query was crafted to replicate typical business intelligence use cases in healthcare data systems.
